# Ideas for Sample Improvements

# GOALS
## *** Prompt users upon data upload to define columns as references to controlled metadata keys ***
## Segment key metadata terms by template (instead of combining into 1 amorphous mass)
## Common controlled metadata keys that can be aliased within templates (defined by the users) to create linkage of meaning

# Steps
## 1.) Create a KBASE terms yaml configuration file for concrete/indisputable terms
	- id
	- collection_date
	- longitude
	- latitude
	 etc...
## 2.) Research/Design: Sample Uploader needs to reflect the changes above. Should prompt user for template transformation
## 3.) Need to track "template" tranformation information with the sample.
## 4.)
